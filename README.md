# Playing Atari Breakout with Hand Recognition AI

The `main.py` basicly just tracks your hand, and move the mouse to the relative position of your index finger. Also the game in this repo is controlled by the mouse. <br>
You will need to install `mediapipe`, `pyautogui` and `opencv-python` packages, you can install all of them with the `pip` tool.


## Game Instructions 
Press `Space` to launch the ball

Some keys from F1 to F12 does somethings <br>
F7 Restart the game <br>
F6 and F9 works in cannon mode <br>
Probabily forgot some key here <br>

**Game easter eggs / cheats:**
 - If you type 'russo' the game will play himself. You can press ESC to get your mouse control back.
 - If you type 'cannon' it will start some shooter like stuff.
 - If you type 'russo' and then 'cannon' it will mix the both things, as I forgot to prevent this to happen.
